## Daniel Reilly

Technical Executive • Platform Architect • Operator

I build high-velocity delivery systems and scale operating models across engineering, product, GTM and operations. I lead through systems, turning execution into strategy.

### What I Bring

- **Architectural Clarity Without Drag**  
  I define clear boundaries, modular interfaces, and decision layers that let teams move fast without trading off long-term integrity.

- **Leadership That Scales Teams**  
  I build cultures of trust, accountability, and autonomy, scaling teams through structured practice and measurable outcomes.

- **Strategy Through Delivery**  
  I partner with founders and execs to turn product vision into scalable operating models, bridging architecture, process, and talent.


### Areas of Focus

-	Team Architecture - Designing roles, rituals, and career frameworks that scale IC growth and leadership capacity.
-	Delivery Systems - Building reliable, low-friction workflows that sustain velocity, ownership, and trust.
-	Platform Design - Architecting modular systems with strong developer experience and operational safety baked in.
-	Engineering ROI - Driving visibility into cost, productivity, and outcomes to guide investment and growth.

### Writing
