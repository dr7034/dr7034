## Hello ðŸ‘‹

<!-- WIDGET_START -->

I'm an engineering leader with experience across startups, scale-ups, and enterprises. I own technical direction, organisation scaling, and driving platforms through exponential growth phases. I remove operational bottlenecks and empower ICs to take ownership of their delivery and growth trajectory.

I've led platform builds and rebuilds, built scalable infrastructure, and integrated key performance metrics to improve delivery speed and reliability. My approach is rooted in developer efficiency, reducing drag, and fostering high-performing teams with a deep sense of ownership.

I focus on building sustainable delivery cadences, leading cross-functional teams, and driving continuous improvement through agile processes and incident response practices.
