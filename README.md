## Hello üëã

I‚Äôm Daniel, an engineering leader who scales teams, platforms, and execution. I own technical direction, architect for growth, and remove the bottlenecks that slow delivery. My focus is building systems and cultures where engineers move fast and grow while doing it.

### What I Bring

- **Architectural Clarity at Speed**  
  I define clean interfaces and technical boundaries without slowing execution, enabling teams to ship quickly without accruing technical debt.

- **Leadership That Scales Teams**  
  I build high-trust engineering cultures where sustainable velocity, resilience, and ownership are defaults.

- **Strategic Partnership**  
  I operate as a technical counterpart to founders and execs, translating product bets into delivery systems and org design that hold at scale.


### Areas of Focus

- Designing teams that scale. Defining roles, rituals, and career frameworks that unlock IC performance  
- Building delivery systems that support ownership, trust, and sustainable velocity  
- Architecting modular platforms with strong developer experience and operational safety  
- Driving visibility across cost, productivity, and engineering ROI to guide growth

### Writing

I publish essays on engineering leadership, system design, and delivery operations at [blog.danielreilly.dev ‚Üó](https://blog.danielreilly.dev).

### Frameworks and Tooling
